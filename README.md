# VHS-Rip
A small TKinter project to work with the OSPREY-200 Capture Card. Technically rips more than VHSes- anything with a composite out is fair game
Hopefully will be platform independent in the future, but is currently configured to work with an OSPREY-200, a CUDA capable video card, and linux systems
